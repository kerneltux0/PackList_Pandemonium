# PackList Pandemonium

This provides a way to create packing lists for a variety of situations, from a local weekend getaway, to camping trips, to extended overseas travel, and manage the list(s) through a user account.  The only information needed to create an account is a username & password.  No PII (personally-identifiable information), such as: given name, address, phone number is gathered and/or stored.

## Usage

This app is hosted on Heroku at: (insert url from Heroku here)

After going to that URL, you should be directed to a welcome screen with options to sign up & login.  After creating an account & logging in, you'll be presented with links to create a new list, see all of the lists that you've created, and delete your account.

## Contributing

Please utilize the "dev" branch for all contributions; submit all pull requests to that branch, any pull requests to the "master" branch will be denied, as that is the production codebase for the live web-site.

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org) code of conduct.
