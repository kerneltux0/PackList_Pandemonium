# PackList Pandemonium

This provides a way to create packing lists for a variety of situations, from a local weekend getaway, to camping trips, to extended overseas travel, and manage the list(s) through a user account.  The only information needed to create an account is a username & password.  No PII (personally-identifiable information), such as: given name, address, phone number is gathered and/or stored.

## Installation

In your terminal, clone this repo, then navigate to that directory, and type "bundle install" (without quotations) to load all necessary dependencies.  Then type "shotgun" (again, no quotations), open your web-browser of choice and enter the address provided by shotgun.

## Usage

After following the installation instructions, you should be directed to a welcome screen with options to sign up & login.  After creating an account & logging in, you'll be presented with links to create a new list, see all of the lists that you've created, and delete your account.
